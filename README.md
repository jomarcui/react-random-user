# React Random User

This is an assignment from a potential employer.

I used <em>axios</em> as a replacement for "fetch".

Please note that I purposely did not use the following:

<ul>
  <li>
    <em>async</em>/<em>await</em> - No need to await the retrieval of data from api, but the function is async
  </li>
  <li>
    <em>local storage</em> - I feel like there is no need to store a single dynamic random person data in local storage
  </li>
</ul>
 in this project as I feel there is no need
to pause the async function

## Tech Used

<ul>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Typescript</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>randomuser.me/api</li>
</ul>

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run <code>npm install</code>

In the project directory, you can run:

<code>npm start</code>

Runs the app in the development mode.
